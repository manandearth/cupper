I am a software developer producing webapps in Clojure/ClojureScript and JS React.

I type in Emacs, organise and document in OrgMode.

I deal with data. I'm interested in its meanings, implications, and representations. 

I wish to do so to promote the interests of life on this planet over short term profit.

I am also a father to 3 teeanagers and a 6 years old, an instrument maker, a wooden house builder, an amateur multidiciplinary artist, and slowly but steady a barefoot runner.
